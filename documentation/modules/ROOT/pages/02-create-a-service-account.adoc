= Manage Access to Kafka Instances

To connect your applications or services to a Streams for Apache Kafka instance, you need to create a service account.

[#serviceaccount]
== Create a Service Account

. On the *Kafka Instances* overview page, select the *Options* icon (the three dots) for the Kafka instance you just created. Select *Connection* to display connection information.

. Copy the *Token endpoint URL* of the *SASL/OAUTHBEARER* authentication method to a secure location. You will need this URL when connecting to your Kafka instance.

. Click *Create service account* to set up the service account. Enter a unique service account name and an optional description, and click *Create*.

. Copy the generated *Client ID* and *Client Secret* to a secure location. These are the credentials that you’ll use to connect to this Kafka instance.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The generated credentials are displayed only one time, so ensure that you’ve successfully and securely saved the copied credentials before closing the credentials window. 
====

. After saving the generated credentials, select the confirmation check box and close the Credentials window.

You’ll use the service account information that you saved to configure your application to connect to your Kafka instances when you’re ready. For example, if you plan to use link:https://github.com/edenhill/kcat[kcat] to interact with your Kafka instance, you’ll use this information to set your bootstrap server and client environment variables.

[#serviceaccountpermissions]
== Set Permissions for a Service Account

After you create a service account to connect to a Kafka instance, you must also set the appropriate level of access for that new account in the Access Control List (ACL) of the Kafka instance. Streams for Apache Kafka uses ACLs provided by Kafka that enable you to manage how other user accounts and service accounts are permitted to interact with the Kafka resources that you create.

. On the *Kafka Instances* page, click the name of the Kafka instance you previously created.

. Click the *Access* tab to view the current ACL for this instance.

. Click *Manage access*, use the *Account* drop-down menu to select the service account that you previously created, and click *Next*.

. Under *Assign Permissions*, use the drop-down menus to set the permissions shown in the following table for this service account. Click *Add* to add each new resource permission.
+
These permissions enable applications associated with the service account to create and delete topics in the instance, to produce and consume messages in any topic in the instance, and to use any consumer group and any producer.
